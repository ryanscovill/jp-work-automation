# JP Work Automation

A comprehensive automation suite for workplace safety documentation and form filling processes. This project streamlines the creation and management of safety procedures and automates form submissions for WorkSafe BC Notice of Project (NOP) applications.

## Overview

This automation toolkit consists of two main components:

1. **Procedure Generator**: Automatically generates Safe Work Procedure (SWP) PDFs by combining work orders with standardized templates and procedure documents
2. **WorkSafe NOP Automation**: Automates the filling of WorkSafe BC Notice of Project forms using web automation with Playwright

The system is designed to reduce manual work, improve consistency, and ensure compliance with safety documentation requirements.
